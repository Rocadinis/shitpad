The worst text editor ever made

# What is shitpad?
Simply the worst excuse for a text editor. Make Vim users tremble as you open up Shitpad and start editing any kind of file inside it.
It currently supports:
<ul>
    <li> File opening </li>
    <li> File saving </li>
    <li> Text editing and deleting </li>
</ul>
<s>You can even develop shitpad inside shitpad! Shitpadception!</s>

# The problematic

As shitpad's development continued, I realized that I was drifting away from shitpad's original concept. Shitpad was improving - it was actually becoming *good*. So I thought, "maybe that's actually not bad at all". I will continue developing shitpad, but I have plans in mind for a version called **nanoshitpad**, in other words, a version of shitpad that is even more lightweight than the original, making it even less user-friendly and more "get to the point"-type.
I will continue developing shitpad for the 3 fans out here (one of them being me and the two others being random people that might have stumbled upon this repository), attempting to carry out more updates and improvements.
